{"timestamp":"2026-01-14T06:16:11.520Z","role":"assistant","text":"Restarting Local Server\nI need to restart the local server, as the user wants to \"deploy lại local\". I've implemented several Mac-specific fixes and believe a  restart is the proper action to ensure all the changes are applied.\nAssessing Running Processes\nI'm now in the process of assessing the  commands. There were initially two instances running; one in  for 10 minutes, the other for 1 minute. I'm focusing on ensuring only one instance with the latest code is active. I terminated all of the existing processes, and am now checking their status.\nInspecting Port Usage\nI'm currently focused on the command . My primary goal is to determine which processes, if any, are utilizing port 8000. I'm carefully examining the output to pinpoint any conflicts.\nInitializing Backend Server\nI've confirmed port 8000 is available. I'm now starting the backend server and will make sure the user knows that the frontend will be served from http://localhost:8000. I'll maintain consistency by using the  script for this.\nObserving Server Startup\nI'm watching the server boot up; I anticipate seeing IP addresses soon. I'm keen to confirm the network configuration. I am expecting the final output of the server startup.\nTôi đã khởi động lại (re-deploy) bản local sạch sẽ cho bạn. Toàn bộ các bản sửa lỗi dành cho Mac (Clipboard, AppleScript Automation) hiện đã được áp dụng và sẵn sàng hoạt động.\n🚀 Trạng thái hiện tại:\n\nServer Local: Đang chạy tại http://localhost:8000\nTruy cập mạng nội bộ (Điện thoại/Máy tính khác): http://192.168.5.151:8000\n\n🛠️ Bước tiếp theo để chat được:\n\nNếu Antigravity đang mở: Hãy tắt hẳn đi.\nMở Terminal và chạy lệnh này để mở Antigravity đúng chế độ:\n\n\nBây giờ bạn có thể mở web và bắt đầu chat.\n\nLưu ý cực kỳ quan trọng trên Mac: Khi bạn gửi tin nhắn lần đầu, macOS sẽ hỏi quyền Accessibility (Trợ năng). Bạn nhớ vào Cài đặt hệ thống để cấp quyền cho Terminal hoặc trình duyệt, có như vậy AntiBridge mới có thể tự động \"nhấn phím\" Paste/Enter vào Antigravity giúp bạn được.\ncd \"/Users/quanghung/My Drive (hungdqdesign@gmail.com)/10. Project/AI Project/AntiBridge-main\" && ./OPEN_ANTIGRAVITY_MAC.sh\nDebugging Network Connection Issues\nI'm currently trying to understand why I'm getting a \"This site can't be reached\" error. Based on what I have observed, I launched the server using the  script, which appeared to run successfully. Now, I'm trying to figure out why I can't connect to  despite the seeming successful server launch.\nAnalyzing Connection Refusal\nI've hit a roadblock. The browser is reporting that  refused the connection, which complicates things. My next step involves inspecting the server's status, specifically the command , to determine if it's running as expected or encountering issues. I'm focusing on why the connection was refused, not the initial seemingly-successful server launch.\nAssessing Server Status\nI believe the server is no longer running, it might have finished or even crashed! The usual state is \"RUNNING\". I'll quickly check  to see if port 8000 is still active.\nInspecting Server Startup\nI'm now investigating the server's startup sequence. It seems like it crashed immediately. I'm taking a look at the  script to see if I can pinpoint the issue. Perhaps there's an obvious error that prevented a smooth launch.\nTroubleshooting Startup Issues\nI'm now running  directly within the  folder to bypass the script and observe the full output. This should help me pinpoint any hidden errors during startup. The direct execution approach will hopefully expose the root cause, if it's there.\nObserving Server Stability\nI'm seeing some positive signs. The server appears stable now when run using this method. I'm verifying this by checking the status of .\nDiagnosing Connection Failure\nI've got the server running, but the user's browser reports a \"refused to connect\" error at the specified IP. Now, the context is shifting; the user might be checking the server's stability post-deployment. The browser tab confirms the IP, suggesting the core issue is likely network-related between the client and the server.\nPinpointing Server Configuration\nI'm now investigating how the server is configured to listen. The IP \"192.168.5.151\" is failing. I see that the user has multiple tabs open, which isn't the primary concern, but might be an interesting detail. I must ensure the server is listening on the network interface, not just \"localhost.\" The  file is the next target for a look.\nVerifying Network Connectivity\nI've confirmed that the server is listening on , the correct setting for network access. The \"refused to connect\" error has me puzzled, but I'm leaning toward a server-side issue. Although I just re-ran  and got the  message, it is possible the previous attempt crashed. I need to be sure it's stable.\nDouble-Checking Server Status\nI'm now re-examining the server's output, specifically the  process. I suspect a port binding conflict may be at play, so I'm investigating whether port 8000 was already partially in use. This could explain the intermittent connection refusals. Ensuring the process is stable is the top priority.\nChecking Server Access\nI've brought the server back online and believe it's ready. Just to be safe, I'm making sure the user knows to verify the IP address if their network is different; the log currently shows 192.168.5.151.\nChào bạn, tôi đã kiểm tra và thấy server local bị dừng (crash) ngay sau khi khởi động ở lượt trước, đó là lý do bạn gặp lỗi \"Refused to connect\" trong hình ảnh.\nTôi đã thực hiện deploy lại bản local một lần nữa và lần này server đã chạy ổn định.\n🌐 Thông tin kết nối hiện tại:\n\nĐịa chỉ Local: http://localhost:8000\nĐịa chỉ Mạng (cho điện thoại): http://192.168.5.151:8000\n\nBạn vui lòng:\n\nF5 (Gia hạn) lại trang web trên trình duyệt.\nĐảm bảo bạn đã chạy script OPEN_ANTIGRAVITY_MAC.sh để AntiBridge có thể kết nối được với Antigravity IDE.\n\nNếu vẫn gặp lỗi, hãy cho tôi biết nhé!\nTroubleshoot Mac AntiBridge Chat\nRan background terminal commandOpen in Terminal · Exit code 1Always Proceed\n~/…/AntiBridge-main $ ./START_MAC.sh\n[*] Starting server...\n\n> phonebridge-agenthub-backend@1.0.0 start\n> node server.js\n\n✅ SessionStore: Database initialized at /Users/quanghung/My Drive (hungdqdesign@gmail.com)/10.
